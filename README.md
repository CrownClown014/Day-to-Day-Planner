# Day-to-Day-Planner

Description:
This day to day planner was made to be utilized to help individuals plan their day.  A lot of people including myself have many tasks and events that are difficult to keep track of.  Most of the time we tend to try to remember the tasks that need to be completed, then hope for the best that they are all complete.  But i can speak from experience that it is impossible to tract daily activities without a planner.  Most likely, there will be a couple of tasks that will not be completed.  This planner will help those people keep track of their day by scheduling their task hourly and saving them to the local storage.  In case you were to exit out of your screen you can come backand still view your saved events.

Usage:

To help those who stuggle to plan their daily tasks.  Each hour will have a color that specifies past, present, and future.  In each timeblock, individuals will be able to add their task and click the save button.  This save will store the value into the local storage.  


** I should have more commit but i do not know what appenned.  when i tried to commit individual files i was given an error but i could do git add -a and then commit.  When trying to push I received an error that i needed to pull before pushing?  Could not figure out so i deleted the repository and created a new one.
